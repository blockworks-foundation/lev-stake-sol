      </p>

      <h2>2. Non-Custodial Nature of Yield Fan and the Website</h2>

      <p>
        The Foundation does not facilitate or provide brokerage, exchange,
        payment, escrow, remittance or merchant services. The Foundation is not
        a broker/dealer or a provider of securities services, and is not
        registered with the SEC or similar securities regulators in other
        jurisdictions. The Foundation is not a depository institution and is not
        registered with or insured by any governmental agency. Your tokens are
        stored in a digital wallet you control, and over which The Foundation
        exercises no control. Though multiple wallets are supported, The
        Foundation does not recommend any particular wallet. The onus is on the
        user to select an appropriate wallet to utilize in connection with Yield
        Fan, and to take all proper steps to ensure the security and integrity
        of said wallet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yield Fan utilizes a permissionless system, meaning that user activity
        is not subject to review or approval by The Foundation, nor are assets
        screened before listing or subject to removal. The Foundation makes no
        representations as to the liability or prudence of using third party
        services and is not responsible for any technical shortcomings of
        third-party programs, errors arising from user installation or
        configuration, or other security vulnerabilities caused by software
        deployments or hardware environments controlled or configured by the
        user. Any information provided by the Foundation are offered as-is, with
        no representation that they are free from technical error. Users making
        use of the Website do so at their own risk, and are advised to proceed
        with caution.
      </p>

      <p>
        In connection with your use of the Website, you are required to pay all
        fees necessary for interacting with certain blockchain networks,
        including, without limitation, the Solana blockchain. Such fees may
        include “gas” costs, as well as all other fees reflected Website at the
        time of your activity, including trading fees and network access fees.
        The Foundation cannot assist in the recovery of fees from transactions
        you execute improperly, and/or any fees paid to third parties for the
        use of resources said parties supply to the blockchain.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>

      <p>
        TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE FOUNDATION
        DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER
        EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DATA
        ACCURACY, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND/OR QUIET
        ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WEBSITE PROVIDED BY THE FOUNDATION ARE PROVIDED “AS
        IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU HEREBY
        ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL DISCLAIMERS OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING IN THIS SECTION
        AND ELSEWHERE IN THESE TERMS OF USE) ARE MADE FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH
        THE FOUNDATION AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS,
        DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND REPRESENTATIVES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
        SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU
        REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
        OF THE FOUNDATION OR ITS AFFILIATES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
        THESE TERMS OF USE. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
        THAT ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE SHALL BE CONTINUOUS, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY,
        OR ERROR-FREE.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the Foundation will try to maintain the timeliness, integrity, and
        security of the Website, you understand that we cannot and do not
        guarantee or warrant that the Website, and any files available for
        downloading from the Site will be free of viruses or other destructive
        code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and
        checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus
        protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a
        means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Risk of Digital Assets and Decentralized Networks</h2>

      <p>
        Please note that all transactions involving digital assets involve
        risks. You should therefore carefully consider whether using the Website
        is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering
        whether to hold digital assets, you should be aware that the price or
        value of digital assets can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially
        even fall to zero. Past performance is not an indicator of future
        performance. By utilizing the Website, you acknowledge that you are able
        to incur a complete loss of monies or amounts paid without impairing
        your financial condition, and you are able to bear the entire economic
        risk of using the Website for an indefinite period of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are not responsible for any digital asset market and we make no
        representations or warranties concerning the real or perceived value of
        digital assets as denominated in any quoted currency. Although we may
        provide historical and/or real-time data regarding the price of digital
        assets, we make no representations regarding the quality, suitability,
        truth, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data, and you
        should not rely on such data for any reason whatsoever. You understand
        and agree that the value of digital assets can be volatile, and we are
        not in any way responsible or liable for any losses you may incur by
        using or transferring digital assets in connection with the Website.
        Digital assets which may be referenced on the Website have not been
        reviewed by The Foundation, and The Foundation makes no representation
        as to the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any digital
        assets that you may transfer to or from a third party. You acknowledge
        that The Foundation, through the Website is not offering or executing
        exchange services but is merely providing a digital interface through
        which you can engage with the blockchain directly to exchange assets at
        your sole discretion and of your own accord, subject to other
        limitations stipulated within these Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <p>
        You acknowledge that it is your duty to ensure correct information is
        inputted for any and all trades you initiate which you directly execute
        on the blockchain. At no point does The Foundation take custody of
        digital assets being traded, and consequently The Foundation is unable
        to assist in digital asset retrieval caused by user error. You further
        acknowledge that we are not responsible for any loss of your digital
        asset resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of digital asset
        private keys outside our control. You must take sufficient steps to
        safeguard seed phrases, private keys, 2FA devices, and all other
        user-controlled assets that are vulnerable to hacking or theft.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not provide investment advice and any content contained on the
        Website should not be considered as a substitute for tailored investment
        advice. The contents of the Website should not be used as a basis for
        making investment decisions.
      </p>

        We endeavor to verify the accuracy of any information displayed,
        supplied, passing through, or originating from the Website, but such
        information may not always be accurate or current. Accordingly, you
        should independently verify all information before relying on it, and

        the Website.

      <p>
        In using the Website, you may view content provided by third parties,

        do not control, endorse, or adopt any Third Party Content and have no
        responsibility for Third Party Content, including, without limitation,
        material that may, among other things, be inaccurate, misleading,
        incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable
        in your jurisdiction. In addition, your dealings or correspondence with
        such third parties are solely between you and the third party. We are
        not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as
        a result of any such dealings, and your use of Third Party Content is at
        your own risk and is subject to any additional terms, conditions, and
        policies applicable to such Third Party Content (such as terms of use or
        privacy policies of the providers of such Third Party Content). We have
        no obligation to monitor Third Party Content, and we may block or
        disable access to any Third Party Content (in whole or in part) through
        the Website at any time.

        THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SAID JURISDICTIONS, ALL
        LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PERMITTED BY LAW REMAIN IN EFFECT.
      </p>

      <p>
