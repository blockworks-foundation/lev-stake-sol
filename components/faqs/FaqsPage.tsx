    question: 'How does Boost! work?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Boost! allows you to increase your position size by borrowing USDC and
        swapping it into JLP. This means you earn more yield from the JLP pool
        because you have a larger position size. As long as this yield exceeds
        the rate of the USDC borrow you earn a premium.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'How does unboosting work?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        Unboosting works by selling your JLP tokens to repay your USDC borrow
        and withdrawing to your wallet. The JLP price increases vs USDC over
        time so the longer you hold the position the more yield you earn.
      </p>

    question: 'What are the risks?',
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          The following risks are non-exhaustive. It&apos;s important to have a
          good understanding of these risks and how Boost! works before
          depositing any funds
        </p>
        <h4>Code</h4>
        <p>
          Boost! is an integration with the Mango v4 program. Although it is
          open source and has been audited extensively, it&apos;s possible bugs
          and exploits exist that could result in the loss of funds. It&apos;s
          also possible for a bug in the UI to affect the ability to open and
          close positions in a timely manner.
        </p>
        <h4>Price Action</h4>
        <p>
          It&apos;s possible for the price of JLP to fluctuate. A large drop in
          price could result in postions being liquidated. Positions with higher
          leverage are more exposed to this risk.
        </p>
        <h4>Liquidity</h4>
        <p>
          Opening and closing positions on Boost! relies on swapping between JLP
          and USDC without significant price impact. During an extreme market
          event there could be issues liquidating position effectively. This
          could affect the liquidity available to open/close positions.
        </p>
        <h4>Oracles</h4>
        <p>
          The price data for Boost! comes from third party oracle providers.
          It&apos;s possible for the data to be incorrect due to a failure with
          the oracle provider. This could result in bad liquidations and loss of
          funds.
        </p>
        <h4>Yield Duration</h4>
        <p>
          When you borrow USDC to open a position on Boost! you&apos;ll be
          paying interest on the borrowed amount instantaneously. The JLP yield
          accrues over a longer duration. This means you could open a position
          and close it before earning any staking rewards whilst paying interest
          to borrow USDC.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'Where does the yield come from?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        The JLP token earns a portion of the fees collected by the Jupiter
        perpetuals exchange.{' '}

    ),
  },
  // {
  //   question: 'Why is the max leverage different between tokens?',
  //   answer: (
  //     <p>
  //       The Mango v4 program has a safety mechanism that reduces the leverage
  //       available to tokens depending on how much of that token is deposited.
  //       When the notional value of deposits exceeds this value the leverage is
  //       scaled down.
  //     </p>
  //   ),

    question: 'Why is my Ledger not working with Boost!?',
    answer: (
      <p>
        If your Ledger isn&apos;t working it&apos;s most likely because it
        doesn&apos;t support versioned transactions.

                  Leveraged staking with Boost! amplifies yields by recursively
                  borrowing and lending between SOL and its supported tokens:
                  mSOL, jitoSOL, bSOL, and stSOL. Users can deposit any of these
                  tokens and then borrow SOL to enhance their returns.
                </p>

                <p>Example with jitoSOL:</p>
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
                  <li>
                    A user deposits jitoSOL into Mango&apos;s borrowing/lending
                    program via Boost!.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Boost! then leverages the deposited jitoSOL to borrow SOL,
                    based on the user&apos;s desired leverage ratio on Mango.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This process effectively increases the user&apos;s position
                    size in jitoSOL, amplifying the base yield.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  When the returns from staking surpass the costs of borrowing,
                  users enjoy a premium from this enhanced staking with Boost!.

                  <li>
                    There&apos;s a risk that tokens like mSOL, jitoSOL, bSOL, or
                    stSOL may deviate significantly from the SOL price. If the
                    token prices drop by 20% or SOL gains a premium of 18.5%,
                    your position may face liquidation, particularly for high
                    leverage positions. Deppegs, although infrequent, can occur
                    due to market liquidity, pricing anomalies, or smart
                    contract bugs.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Liquidity pertains to quickly converting staked tokens into
                    SOL without major price impact.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The underlying liqduid staking tokens as well as Mango are
                    susceptible to risks linked to smart contract flaws and UI
                    mishaps, which might lead to unexpected results or fund
                    losses.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    If your margin ratio falls below maintenance, you risk
                    liquidation. A drop in staked asset value below the
                    maintenance margin can result in partial or total sale of
                    your collateral. Your liquidation ratio is displayed in the
                    user interface.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Mango depends on external oracles for pricing. Inaccuracies
                    from these oracles, whether due to technical issues,
                    manipulation, etc., can cause undesired liquidations,
                    potentially causing losses.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Instant SOL borrow interest payments contrast with token
                    staking rewards paid every epoch (~2.5 days). Thus, users
                    entering and exiting within these boundaries might pay
                    interest without gaining staking rewards. It&apos;s vital to
